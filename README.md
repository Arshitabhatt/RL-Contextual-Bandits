# Vaccine Distribution using Contextual Bandits

This repo contains code for RL based contextual bandits for COVID-19 Vaccine distribution. (this project is a part of research for my internship at IIITD).
Contextual-Bandits are an extention of Multi-Arm Bandits where, given a context and reward from a particular set of actions, a single action is chosen such that to maximize the reward in online setting.
Here we have 2 notebooks
1. CB_Demo_Space_Bandits : This contains the implementation of Contextual Bandits using Space-Bandit library and it is a ready-to-run copy of the original experiments.
2. Vaccine_Implementing_a_Contextual_Bandit_Using_VW's_Python_Wrapper :  This contains the implementation of Contextual Bandits using Vowpal Wabbit library.
